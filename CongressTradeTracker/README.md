Stock trading among members of Congress has long been a controversial topic due to their access to sensitive, non-public information, which may give them an unfair advantage in the market. To address this, Congress is legally required to disclose their trades publicly. While some platforms, like Autopilot, enable users to mimic these trades automatically, they often lack personalization. This is where the Congress Trade Tracker steps in. Our app transforms publicly available congressional trading data into easily digestible insights, empowering users to make informed decisions. Beyond simplifying the data, the app leverages advanced predictive models to analyze trends and provide tailored trade recommendations, helping users maximize their investment strategies with actionable intelligence.
